## Detailed Project 

### Sheet 1-Yearly Sales:

A simple line chart depecting the sales by Month. I have also added the average sales line.
I have used Orderdate(Month) on the columns and Sales(sum) on the Rows. I have used a date filter on Year which enables the user to select the year for which he wants to see the data.


### Sheet 2- Sales by Catagory:

A Simple bar chart showing sales by Catagory.

Rows : Category - Sorted by ascending order by sales

Columns :  Sales - Used sales on colors on the marks pane to visualize different colors for sales in different catagories.
            I have used Orange Gold pallate for colors.

### Sheet 3 - Sales by Quantity:

A Simple Histogram Showing Sales by bin size of 2.

Rows : Quantity

Columns : Bin(quantity) - Autogenerated when you click on the histogram chart

### Sheet 4 - Sales Map:

A map showing the sales by each state. For this it is necessary to put the country, state, region and city in hirerchy.
Now, Drag and drop the country to detail in the Marks pane and change the hirerchy to state.
Then, Drag and drop the sales to size in the Marks shelf. Change the map to normal map instead og a symbol map in the show me dropdown.

### Headline cards:

        Sales: Show sales as a text box
        Quantity: Show quantity as a text box
        Profit: Use Calculated field and write a formula for profit column as [Sales]*0.3 and then use it as a text box

### Dashboard:

Dashboard Size : 1300 x 900

I have used Horizontal and vertical objects to place various sheets. Just drag and drop the sheets and adjust the sizes as per your conveinence.

Filter : Made on Order Date(year) and apply it to apply on all the worksheets.

Click on use as a filter for sales by category and Sales map to filter based on states and category
